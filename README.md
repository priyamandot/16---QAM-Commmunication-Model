# 16---QAM-Commmunication-Model
## Project Overview

This project develops and simulates a communication model utilizing 16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation). 16-QAM is a modulation scheme widely used in digital communication systems for transmitting digital data over radio and optical communication channels. The project involves designing a communication system that encodes digital information into 16-QAM symbols, transmits them through a simulated channel, and decodes them back to the original data.
