# 16---QAM-Commmunication-Model
## Project Overview

This project develops and simulates a communication model utilizing 16-QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation). 16-QAM is a modulation scheme widely used in digital communication systems for transmitting digital data over radio and optical communication channels. The project involves designing a communication system that encodes digital information into 16-QAM symbols, transmits them through a simulated channel, and decodes them back to the original data.

16QAM utilizes 16 different amplitude and phase combinations (in figure below) to encode four bits per symbol. It is commonly employed in applications where a balance between data rate and spectral efficiency is required. Each symbol in 16QAM represents a unique combination of both amplitude and phase, allowing for efficient transmission of digital data.
